Daily PDF Plan

A PDF generated daily and set to me via email/slack/or some other highly convenient method.
A highly tailored layout with an emphasis on brevity and ease of consumption: Colours, markdown, icons, etc

Weather
- Icons with forecast of the day
    - Rain/Snow
    - Wind
    - Temp

- Exceptions
    - Northern Lights
    - etc

Stocks
- S&P 500 close
- Tesla close
- Nvidia close
- Bitcoin close

World News
- Strictly only unique major news
    - I'd rather miss something than receive too much
    - Focusing on events like major and new wars
    - Strange or unique economic events

Space News
- Strictly only unique news
    - Expected behaviour is this to be mostly skipped
- Rocket launches
- Major deals/partnerships

Unique in Copenhagen today
- Any unique events or news in or concerning Copenhagen
    - This should be left blank if there are none
    - Expected behaviour is this to be mostly skipped



PDF Priorities
- Less is more, I'd rather miss news than receive too much
- Consistency is key
